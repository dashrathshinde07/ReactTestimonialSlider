App Component (App.js):

This is the main component of your React application.
It imports the Testimonials component from ./components/Testimonials.
It imports the reviews data from ./data.
In the JSX, it renders the Testimonials component and passes the reviews data as props.
Testimonials Component (Testimonials.js):

This component is responsible for displaying testimonials and navigation buttons.
It receives props, destructures the reviews data from the props, and initializes a state variable index using the useState hook to keep track of the current testimonial index.
It defines three functions:
leftShiftHandler: Decrements the index to navigate to the previous testimonial. If the current index is at the beginning, it loops back to the last testimonial.
rightShiftHandler: Increments the index to navigate to the next testimonial. If the current index is at the end, it loops back to the first testimonial.
surpriseHandler: Sets the index to a randomly generated index within the range of testimonial data length.
In the JSX, it renders:
The Card component with the review at the current index.
Navigation buttons (<FiChevronLeft /> and <FiChevronRight />) for shifting between testimonials.
A "Surprise Me" button that triggers the surpriseHandler function.
Card Component (Card.js):

This component is responsible for rendering individual testimonial cards.
It receives props containing a single review object.
In the JSX, it displays the reviewer's name, job, image, testimonial text, and quotation icons (<FaQuoteLeft /> and <FaQuoteRight />).
Reviews Data (data.js):

This file contains an array of review objects.
Each review object contains properties such as id, name, job, image, and text, representing different aspects of a testimonial.
Overall Flow:

When the application loads, the App component renders the Testimonials component.
The Testimonials component displays the testimonial corresponding to the current index and provides navigation buttons to cycle through testimonials.
Users can also click the "Surprise Me" button to display a random testimonial.
Testimonial data is stored separately in the reviews array and is imported into the components where needed.
